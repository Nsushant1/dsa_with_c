Algorithm for push operation:
1. If stack is full then display stack is full. If stack is not full then go to step 2.
2. Increment top by 1.
3. Set stack[top] = item.
4. Exit.

Algorithm for pop operation:
1. If stack is empty then display stack is empty. If stack is not empty then go to step 2.
2. Set item = stack[top].
3. Decrement top by 1.
4. Exit.

Algorithm for display operation:
1. If stack is empty then display stack is empty. If stack is not empty then go to step 2.
2. Repeat step 3 and 4 for i = top to 0.
3. Display stack[i].
4. Exit.
