# DSA with C

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the C programming language. It serves as a learning resource and a reference for fundamental DSA concepts.

## Features
- **Basic Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search
- **Dynamic Programming**: Common DP problems and solutions
- **Code Examples**: Well-commented and structured implementations

## Technologies Used
- **C Language**: Core programming language for implementation
- **GCC Compiler**: Used for compilation and testing

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-with-c.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd dsa-with-c
   ```
3. Compile a specific program:
   ```sh
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./output
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add more problem-solving examples
